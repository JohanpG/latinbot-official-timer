# The Sensor

The sensor used was based on a IR Sender and receiver. The PWM on the sender was controller by an Arduino Micro and the Receiver used an Arduino Uno with was conecter via serial to the PC where the processing Application was being executed. Both schematics for the sender and receiver are provided in this repository.
